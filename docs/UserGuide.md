## Getting Started with FastCard

**Step 1: Install Java (if you haven't already)** <br>
FastCard requires **Java 17 or newer** to run. Java is free software that lets your computer run applications like FastCard.

**Check if you already have Java:**
1. Open your command terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux).
2. Type `java -version` and press Enter.
3. If you see "java version 17" or higher, you're ready. Skip to Step 2.
4. If you see an error or a lower version number, install Java:
    * **Windows users:** Download Java 17 from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationWindows.html#switching-between-java-versions).
    * **Linux users:** Download Java 17 from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationLinux.html#switching-between-java-versions).
    * **Mac users:** Download Java 17 from [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

**Step 2: Download FastCard**
1. Go to the FastCard releases page [here](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/releases).
2. Download the latest `fastcard.jar` file (look for the newest version at the top).
3. Save it somewhere easy to find (like your Desktop or Documents folder).

**Step 3: Set up your FastCard folder**
1. Create a new folder where you want to keep FastCard and all your contact data.
    * Example: Create a folder called "FastCard" in your Documents.
2. Move the `fastcard.jar` file into this folder.
3. Remember this location. This is where all your data will be saved.

**Step 4: Launch FastCard**
**Using the command terminal:**
1. Open your command terminal:
    * **Windows:** Search for "Command Prompt" or "PowerShell"
    * **Mac:** Search for "Terminal" in Spotlight
    * **Linux:** Open your terminal application
2. Navigate to your FastCard folder by typing: `cd path/to/your/FastCard/folder` <br>
   Example: `cd Documents/FastCard`
3. Run FastCard by typing: `java -jar fastcard.jar`
4. Press Enter

**What you should see:** FastCard's window should appear within a few seconds, showing some sample contacts to help you get started.

![FastCard UI](images/Ui.png)

The window shows:
- Contact list (showing sample contacts)
- Result display area (showing command feedback)
- Command box (where you type commands)

**Troubleshooting:**
  * If you see "java is not recognized" &rarr; Java isn't installed correctly. Return to Step 1
  * If you see "file not found" &rarr; You're not in the right folder. Check Step 4.2

**Step 5: Try your first commands**
Type a command in the command box and press **Enter** to execute it.

**Try these example commands:**
1. See all contacts: `list`
2. Add a new contact: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com c/Shopee`
3. Search for a contact: `find John`
4. Delete a contact: (First, note the phone number of a contact you want to remove): `delete John Doe`
5. Get help: `help`

**Step 6: Learn more commands**
Once you're comfortable with the basics, check out the [Features](#features) section below for the complete list of what FastCard can do.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

**WORDS IN CAPITALS = Replace with your information**
* Commands show placeholders in `UPPER_CASE` that you need to replace with actual information.<br>
  Example: in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` can be replaced with `John Doe`, resulting in `add n/John Doe`.

**[Square Brackets] = Optional**
* Anything in square brackets is optional. You can include it or skip it.<br>
  Example: `n/NAME [t/TAG]` means:
    * `n/John Doe t/client` (with optional tag)
    * `n/John Doe` (without tag, still works!)

**Three Dots… = Repeat as needed**
* Items with `…` can be used multiple times or not at all.<br>
  Example: `[t/TAG]…​` means:
    * ` ` (no tags)
    * `t/client` (one tag)
    * `t/client t/highPriority t/hotLead` (multiple tags, add as many as you want!)

**Order Doesn't Matter**
* You can type the information in any order that makes sense to you.<br>
  Example: These commands do the exact same thing:
    * `addbasic n/John Doe p/91234567`
    * `addbasic p/91234567 n/John Doe`

**Extra Words Get Ignored**
* For simple commands like `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`, anything extra you type will be ignored.<br>
  Example: Typing `help 123` or `help please` both just run `help`.

If you're reading this as a PDF and copying commands, be aware that spaces may get removed when you paste them into FastCard. This can cause commands to fail.

**Solution:** After pasting, check that spaces are still there, especially around line breaks.
</box>

### Getting help : `help`

Opens a help window with a link to the complete user guide.

**Format:** `help`

**What you need to know:**
  * No parameters needed - just type `help` and press Enter
  * Opens a popup window with help information
  * You can close the window to return to FastCard
  * You can also press `F1` as a keyboard shortcut

**When to use this:**
  * You forgot how a command works
  * You want to see all available commands
  * You need detailed examples or explanations
  * You're learning FastCard for the first time

**Example: Opening help window**
```
help
```
**You'll see:**
  * A popup window appears with the help message
  * The window displays "Refer to the User Guide:..."
  * You can click the link or copy the URL to access complete documentation

**In the main window:**
  * FastCard remains open in the background
  * You can continue using FastCard after closing the help window

&rarr; Quick access to full documentation when you need guidance

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tips:
  * **Use `F1` shortcut** - Press `F1` on your keyboard for instant help access without typing
  * **Keep guide bookmarked** - Save the user guide URL in your browser for quick reference
  * **Check before experimenting** - Review command formats in the guide before trying new commands

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * Typing `help COMMAND` expecting command-specific help &rarr; FastCard shows general help only (no per-command help)
  * Looking for help in the FastCard application &rarr; Help opens in a separate window, check your screen (you may refer to [here](#known-issues) if you do not see the help window)

### Viewing all contacts : `list`

Shows your complete contact list, displaying everyone in FastCard.

**Format:** `list`

**What you need to know:**
  * No parameters needed - just type `list` and press Enter
  * Removes any active filters or searches

**When to use this:**
  * After you use `find` or `filter` to return to full view
  * You want to see all of contacts
  * To start fresh before a new search or filter

**Example: Viewing all contacts:**
```
list
```
**You'll see:**
```
Listed all persons
```
**In the contact list:**
  * All contacts reappear (any previous filters are removed)

&rarr; Use this as your "reset" command to see everyone after any operation

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tips:
  * **Your reset button** - Think of `list` as your "show everything" reset whenever you're narrowed down
  * **Before filtering** - Run `list` first to ensure you're starting with everyone visible
  * **After accidental filter** - If you filtered by mistake and can't find contacts, `list` brings everyone back

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * Expecting `list` to show filtered results &rarr; It shows **ALL** contacts (removes filters)
  * Thinking contacts are deleted when filtered &rarr; They're just hidden; `list` reveals them all

### Adding a contact quickly: `addbasic`

Quickly saves a contact with just their name and phone number - perfect when you meet someone and want to add details later.

**Format:** `addbasic n/NAME p/PHONE`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Name** (`n/`) - Full name (letters, numbers and spaces only), must be unique
  * **Phone** (`p/`) - At least 3 digits, must be unique

**What you need to know:**
  * The combination of name **AND** phone number must be unique, you can't add two people with the same name and phone number
  * You can add more details later using the `edit` command

**When to use this:**
  * Quick entry during networking events or meetings
  * You only have basic contact information right now
  * Need to capture name and number fast, will add details later
  * Building a contact list from business cards

**Use `add` instead if:** You have complete information (email, company, tags) ready to enter.

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Quick add during a meeting**
```
addbasic n/Sarah Chen p/98765432
```
**You'll see:**
```
You have successfully added this contact:
Name: Sarah Chen
Phone: 98765432
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Sarah Chen appears with her phone number
  * Other fields (email, company, tags) are empty until you add them

&rarr; Adds Sarah Chen immediately. Later, use `edit Sarah Chen e/sarah@example.com c/Shopee`to complete her profile.

**Example 2: Adding multiple contacts quickly**
```
addbasic n/Mike Wong p/91112222
addbasic n/Lisa Kumar p/93334444
addbasic n/David Tan p/95556666
```
**You'll see:**
  * Similar to above

&rarr; Adds three contacts in seconds. Fill in details later when you have time.

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tip: Use `addbasic` during conversations or events to capture contacts immediately. Update with full details later using the `edit` command when you're back at your desk.

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `addbasic n/Alice Tan` &rarr; Missing phone number (both name AND phone are required)
  * `addbasic Alice Tan 91234567` &rarr; Missing prefixes (need `n/` and `p/`)

### **Adding a contact with complete details** : `add`

Adds a contact with full information including name, phone, email, company, and optional tags.

**Format:** `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL c/COMPANY [t/TAG]…`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Name** (`n/`) - Full name (letters, numbers, and spaces only), must be unique
  * **Phone** (`p/`) - At least 3 digits, must be unique
  * **Email** (`e/`) - Valid email company (e.g., name@company.com)
  * **Company** (`c/`) - Company or organization name
  * **Tags** (`t/`) - Optional labels like "client", "colleague" or "vendor" (add as many as you want)

**What you need to know:**
  * The combination of name **AND** phone number must be unique (similar to `addbasic`)
  * All fields except tags are required
  * Add multiple tags by repeating `t/` (e.g., `t/client t/priority`)

**When to use this:**
  * You have all contact information ready to enter.
  * You want to organize contacts with tags immediately.
  * You're adding professional contacts that need full details.

**Use `addbasic` instead if:** You only have a name and phone number right now.

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Adding a client with multiple tags**
```
add n/Sarah Chen p/98765432 e/sarahchen@example.com c/Shopee t/client t/priority t/tech
```
**You'll see:**
```
New person added:
Name: Sarah Chen
Phone: 98765432
Email: sarahchen@example.com
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Sarah Chen appears with all details displayed
  * Tags are shown as colored labels next to the contact
  * Contact is added to the bottom of the current list

&rarr; Adds Sarah Chen with email, company, and three organizational tags for easy filtering

**Example 2: Adding a colleague without tags**
```
add n/Mike Kumar p/87654321 e/mike@company.com c/ABC Industries
```
**You'll see:**
  * Similar to above

&rarr; Adds Mike Kumar with all required details. Tags can be added later using `edit`

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tip:
  * **Create a tagging system** - Use consistent tags like `client`, `vendor`, `colleague`, `priority` across all contacts. This allows you to filter and find contacts quickly!

</box>

**Common Mistakes:**
  * `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@example.com` &rarr; Forgetting to include all required fields (name, phone, email, company)
  * `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@example c/Shopee` &rarr; Incomplete email address (missing domain extension)
  * `add John Doe 91234567 john@email.com Shopee` &rarr; Missing prefixes (need `n/`, `p/`, `e/`, `c/`)
  * `add n/John Doe p/91234567 e/john@example.com c/Shopee t/friend, colleague` &rarr; Don't use commas between tags (repeat `t/` instead)

### Updating contact information: `edit`

Updates an existing contact's information by either their name or position number in the list.

**Format:**
- `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [c/COMPANY] [t/TAG]…​`
- `edit NAME  [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [c/COMPANY] [t/TAG]…​`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Target contact** - Either the contact's `NAME` or their `INDEX` (position number in the displayed list)
  * **At least one field to update** - Any combination of name, phone, email, company, or tags
  * All fields are optional, but you must provide at least one

**What you need to know:**
  * **Edit by index:** Use the number shown next to the contact (must be 1,2, 3, etc.)
  * **Edit by name:** Name matching is case-insensitive (`john doe` = `John Doe`)
  * **Multiple contacts with the same name:** FastCard will show all matches and ask you to edit by index instead
  * **Existing values are replaced:** Your new input completely replaces the old information

**When to use this:**
  * You want to update outdated phone numbers or email addresses
  * You want to add company information to contacts added with `addbasic`
  * You need to correct typos in contact details
  * You want to add or change tags for better organization

<box type="warning" seamless>

**⚠️ Important: Tag Replacement Behavior**

When you edit tags, ALL existing tags are **replaced** with your new tags - they don't add to existing ones.

**Example:**
  * Current tags: `[client][priority]`
  * You run: `edit John t/vendor`
  * New tags: `[vendor]` (the `client` and `priority` tags are gone)

**To keep existing tags:** View them first with `list` or `find`, then include all tags you want to keep in your edit command.

**To remove all tags:** Use `t/` with nothing after it: `edit John t/`

</box>

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Adding details to a basic contact (unique match)**
```
edit Alice Tan e/alice@example.com c/Shopee t/client
```
**You'll see:**
```
Edited Person:
Name: Alice Tan
Phone: 91234567
Email: alice@example.com
Company: Shopee
Tags: client
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Alice Tan's email, company and tags are updated
  * Other fields (name, phone) remain unchanged
 
&rarr; Adds email, company, and tags to Alice who was previously added with just name and phone

**Example 2: Edit by name (multiple matches)**
```
edit John Doe e/johndoe@company.com
```
**If multiple John Doe exist, you'll see:**
```
There are multiple contacts’ names matched with the reference.
Please use the edit /index {index} to specify the contact you want to edit in the following list of matched contacts.
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Will only show contacts with the name `John Doe`

**Then run:** `edit 2 e/johndoe@company.com` to edit the specific John Doe

&rarr; Updates information of a specific John Doe contact

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tip: After editing, use `find [NAME]` to confirm your updates were applied correctly

</box>

**Common Mistakes:**
  * `edit John Doe` &rarr; No fields provided (you must include at least one field to update)
  * `edit 0 p/91234567` &rarr; Invalid index (index starts at 1, not 0)

### Searching for contacts by name: `find`

Quickly finds contacts whose names include the words you're looking for.

**Format:** `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **One or more keywords** - Words that appear in the contact's name

**What you need to know:**
  * Only searches **names** (not phone numbers, emails, companies or tags)
  * Not case-sensitive - `john`, `John`, and `JOHN` all find the same contacts
  * Word order doesn't matter - `find Bo Hans` and `find Hans Bo` give identical results
  * Must match **complete words** - `Han` won't find `Hans` (you need the full word)
  * Matches **any** keyword - If you search multiple words, contacts with ANY of those words will appear

**When to use this:**
  * You remember part of someone's name but not their full details
  * You want to quickly pull up one person from a large contact list
  * You're looking for several people at once (by searching multiple names)
  * You need to verify if someone is already in your contacts before adding them

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Finding a specific person**
```
find Sarah
```
**You'll see:**
```
2 persons listed!
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Only contacts with "Sarah" in their name are displayed.
  
&rarr; Shows all contacts with "Sarah" in their name (Sarah Chen, Sarah Kumar, etc.)

**Example 2: Finding multiple people for a meeting**
```
find John Mike Sarah
```
**You'll see:**
  * Same as above

&rarr; Shows everyone with "John" OR "Mike" OR "Sarah" in their name - useful for preparing a meeting attendee list

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tips:
  * **Return to full list** - Use `list` after searching to see all contacts again
  * **Narrow your search** - Use fewer, more specific keywords for better results
  * **Search by tags instead** - If you're looking by tags, use `filter t/TAG` instead

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `find Han` expecting to find "Hans" &rarr; Partial words don't match (must be complete: `find Hans`)
  * `find 91234567` &rarr; Doesn't search phone numbers or any other fields, only names

### Filtering contacts: `filter`

Shows only contacts that have specific tags - perfect for viewing contacts by category like "client", "vendor", or "priority".

**Format:** `filter t/TAG [t/TAG]…`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **At least one tag** - The tag name you want to filter by (e.g., `client` or `vendor`)
  * **Multiple tags (optional)** - Add more tags to broaden your search

**What you need to know:**
  * You must specify at least one tag
  * You can specify more than one tag
    * Contacts with **any** of those tags will appear (not all tags required)
  * Tags are not case-sensitive (`t/client` = `t/CLIENT`)
  * You may list the tags in any order.
  * The exact tag name must match (e.g., `client` won't find contacts tagged with `clients`)

**When to use this:**
  * You want to view all contacts in a specific category (all clients, all vendors, etc.)
  * You want to prepare for meetings by filtering relevant contacts
  * You need to quickly access frequently-contacted groups

**Examples:**

**Example 1: View all clients**
```
filter t/client
```
**You'll see:**
```
3 persons listed!
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Only contacts tagged with "client" are displayed

&rarr; Shows only contacts tagged as "client" - perfect before a client review meeting

**Example 2: View multiple business categories**
```
filter t/client t/vendor t/partner
```
**You'll see:**
  * Same as above

&rarr; Shows anyone tagged as client, vendor, OR partner - useful for business contact overview

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tips:
  * **Return to full list** - Use `list` after searching to see all contacts again
  * **Search by name instead** - If you're looking by name, use `find NAME` instead

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `filter client` &rarr; Missing `t/` prefix (need `filter t/client`)
  * `filter t/` &rarr; Empty tag (must provide at least one tag name)

### Organizing contacts alphabetically: `sort`

Arranges your contacts in alphabetical order based on the field you choose - useful for organizing your list.

**Format:** `sort f/FIELD o/ORDER`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Field** (`f/`) - What to sort by: `name` or `tag`
  * **Order** (`o/`) - Direction: `asc` (ascending/A-Z) or `desc` (descending/Z-A)

**Available fields:**
  * `name` - Sort by contact name
  * `tag` - Sort by the first tag alphabetically

**Available orders:**
  * `asc` or `ascending` - A to Z order
  * `desc` or `descending` - Z to A order

**What you need to know:**
  * You must specify both field and order
  * Field and order are not case-sensitive. (`NAME = name`, `ASC` = `asc`)
  * Contacts without the sorted field appear at the start (ascending) or end (descending)

**When to use this:**
  * You want to organize your contact list for easier scanning
  * You need to prepare alphabetically ordered lists for meetings or reports
  * You want to group contacts by tag categories

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Alphabetize all contacts**
```
sort f/name o/asc
```
**You'll see:**
```
Sorted all persons by name in ascending order
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Contacts are now alphabetically ordered A&rarr;Z by name

&rarr; Orders everyone A-Z by name - perfect for quickly locating someone in a long list

**Example 2: Reverse alphabetical order**
```
sort f/name o/desc
```
**You'll see:**
  * Same as above

&rarr; Orders everyone Z-A by name

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tip:
  * **Check tag organization** - Use `sort f/tag o/asc` to see how well your tagging system groups contacts
  * **Combine with filter** - Filter by tag first, then sort the filtered results: `filter t/client` &rarr; `sort f/name o/asc`

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `sort f/name` &rarr; Missing order (must provide both field **AND** order)
  * `sort o/asc` &rarr; Same as above
  * `sort f/phone o/asc` &rarr; Invalid field (only `name` and `tag` are supported)

### Removing a contact : `delete`

Permanently removes a contact from FastCard - use with caution as this cannot be undone.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**⚠️ WARNING: Permanent Deletion**

Deleted contacts are **permanently removed** and cannot be recovered. Double-check you're deleting the correct person before pressing Enter.

**Best practice:** Use `find NAME` first to verify the contact details before deleting.

</box>

**Format:** 
- `delete NAME`
- `delete INDEX`

**What you need to provide:**
  * **Either:** The contact's `NAME`
  * **Or:** The contact's `INDEX` (position number in the displayed list)

**What you need to know:**
  * **Delete by name or index:** - Deleting by name or index works similarly to the `edit` command
  * **Deletion is permanent** - there is no undo function
  * **Delete by name** - Name matching is case-insensitive (`john doe` = `John Doe`)

**When to use this:** 
  * You want to remove outdated contacts
  * You want to delete test contacts after trying out FastCard
  * You want to clear out incorrect entries

**Examples:**

**Example 1: Delete by name (unique match)**
```
delete Alice Tan
```
**You'll see:**
```
Deleted Person: 
Name: Alice Tan
Phone: 91234567
Email: alice@example.com
Company: Shopee
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Alice Tan is immediately removed and no longer appears.

**Example 2: Delete by name (multiple matches)**
```
delete John Doe
```
**If multiple John Doe exist, you'll see:**
```
Multiple persons named John Doe found. Please specify the index to delete.
2 persons listed!
```
**In the contact list:**
  * Will only show contacts with the name `John Doe`

**Then run:** `delete 2` to delete the specific John Doe

&rarr; Deletes a specific John Doe contact

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tips:
  * **Always verify first** - Use `find NAME` to check contact details before deleting
  * **Note the index carefully** - After each deletion, indexes shift down (what was #3 becomes #2)
  * **Consider editing instead** - If information is outdated, use edit to update rather than delete and re-add

</box>

**Common mistakes:**
  * `delete 0` &rarr; Invalid index (index starts at 1, not 0)
  * `delete 5` when only 3 contacts shown &rarr; Index out of range (must be within displayed list)

### Recalling previous commands - Command History

FastCard allows you to quickly repeat commands that you entered previously - saves time when repeating similar commands.

**How to use:**
  * Press &uarr; (Up Arrow) - Go back in  command history (most recent first)
  * Press &darr; (Down Arrow) - Go forward in command history

**What you need to know:**
  * Command history saves all commands from your current session
  * History persists only for the current session (resets when you restart FastCard)
  * When you reach the end of history, you'll see "End of Command History reached"

**When to use this:**
  * You are repeating similar commands with slight modifications (e.g., adding multiple contacts)
  * You need to correct a typo in a recent command
  * You want to re-run a command that failed due to missing information
  * You want to save time and avoid retyping long commands with many fields
  * You want to check what commands you ran recently

**Example: Recalling your last command**
You previously typed:
```
filter t/vendor
```
Now press &uarr;
**You'll see:**
```
filter t/vendor
```
The command appears in your input box, ready to edit or execute again.

<box type="tip" seamless>

💡 Pro Tip:
  * **Skip retyping** - For complex commands with many fields, recall and modify instead of typing from scratch to save time

**Common mistakes:**
  * Pressing &uarr; then immediately pressing Enter &rarr; Accidentally re-executes the previous command (review it first!)
  * Forgetting to modify recalled commands &rarr; Runs the same command twice (edit before pressing Enter)
  * Expecting history after restart &rarr; History clears when you close FastCard (only lasts current session)

### Removing all contacts : `clear`

Permanently deletes every contact from FastCard - use only when starting completely fresh.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**⚠️ WARNING: This permanently deletes ALL contacts from FastCard. This cannot be undone.**

Before using `clear`:
  * **Backup your data** - Copy the `addressbook.json` file from your FastCard data folder
  * **Triple-check** - Make absolutely sure you want to erase everything

**Use this command ONLY when:** You're certain you want to start with a completely empty contact list.

</box>

**Format:** `clear`

**When NOT to use this:**
  * Removing specific outdated contacts &rarr; Use `delete NAME` instead
  * Cleaning up a few contacts &rarr Use `filter` or `find` then delete individually

**Example: Starting fresh after testing**
```
clear
```
**You'll see one of the following messages (depends on whether there are contacts or not):**
```
Contact book has been cleared!
```
```
Contact book is already empty.
```
**In the contact list:**
  * All contacts disappear immediately
  * You're left with a completely empty contact list

&rarr; Removes all sample contacts you added while learning FastCard

**Common mistakes:**
  * Assuming there's a confirmation &rarr; There isn't - it deletes immediately
  * Thinking you can undo &rarr; You can't - deletion is permanent

### Closing FastCard : `exit`

Closes the FastCard application.

**Format:** `exit`

**What you need to provide:**
  * Nothing - just type `exit` and press Enter

**What you need to know:**
  * All data is automatically saved before closing (no manual save needed)
  * Window closes immediately after command executes

**When to use this:**
  * You're finished managing contacts for now
  * You need to restart FastCard for any reason

**Example: Exiting after usage**
```
exit
```
**You'll see:**
  * FastCard window closes immediately
  * No confirmation message (just exits)

**Alternative ways to close:**
  * Click the `X` button in the window corner
  * Use `Alt+F4` (Windows) or `Cmd+Q` (Mac) keyboard shortcuts

### Saving data

<box type="info" seamless>

**Your data is automatically saved**
FastCard saves your contacts automatically every time you make a change.

**What this means for you:**
  * Add, edit, or delete a contact &rarr; automatically saved.
  * Close FastCard anytime &rarr; your data is safe.
  * No risk of losing work if you forget to save.

**Where your data is stored:** All contacts are saved to your computer's hard drive where the FastCard application is located.

</box>

### Editing the data file

<box type="info" seamless>

Your contact data is stored in a file called `addressbook.json` located in `[JAR file location]/data/`.
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

**⚠️ WARNING: Manual editing is risky**

**If you edit this file incorrectly:**
  * FastCard will delete **ALL** your data and start with an empty file
  * The app may behave unpredictably
  * You could lose all your contacts permanently

**Before editing:**
  * Make a backup copy of the file
  * Only proceed if you understand JSON file format
  * Test with a small change first

**Recommendation:** Use FastCard's commands instead of editing the file directly. It's much safer.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my client contacts to another Computer?** <br>
**A**:
  1. On your old computer, locate the `addressbook.json` file in `[JAR file location]/data/`.
  2. Copy this file to the other computer.
  3. Install FastCard on your other computer.
  4. Replace the new `addressbook.json` file with your copied file.
  5. Restart FastCard. All your contacts should appear.

**Q: Can I undo a command I just entered?** <br>
**A**: No, FastCard doesn't have an undo feature. Commands take effect immediately and are saved automatically. Be especially careful with `delete` and `clear` commands.

**Q: How many vendor/client contacts can FastCard store?** <br>
**A:** FastCard can handle thousands of contacts. Performance depends on your computer's specifications, but typical users won't encounter any limits.

**Q: What happens if FastCard crashes? Will I lose all my client contacts?** <br>
**A:** Your data is safe. Since FastCard saves automatically after every change, you'll only lose any command you were typing when it crashed (not the data itself).

**Q: I accidentally deleted a client contact. Can I recover it?** <br>
**A:** Unfortunately, no. FastCard doesn't have a recycle bin or recovery feature. The contact is permanently deleted. Consider backing up your `addressbook.json`F file regularly.

**Q: Why isn't my command working?** <br>
**A:** Common reasons include:
  * Spelling mistakes (check the exact command format)
  * Missing required information (like phone number for add)
  * Duplicate phone numbers (FastCard won't add someone with an existing number)
  * Typos in the command

## Known issues

**Issues you might encounter**

**App opens off-screen when using multiple screens**

**Problem:** If you used FastCard on a secondary monitor, then disconnected it, the app may open in an invisible location.
**Solution:**
  1. Close FastCard completely.
  2. Find and delete the `preferences.json` file in your FastCard folder.
  3. Restart FastCard. It should open on your main screen.

**Help window stays minimized**

**Problem:** If you minimize the Help window and press `F1` (or type `help`) again, nothing appears to happen.
**What's actually happening:** The Help window is already open but minimized.
**Solution:** Look for the minimized Help window in your taskbar and click it to restore it.
